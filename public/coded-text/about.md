# Smarter Approaches to Reinvigorate Agriculture as an Industry in the Philippines (Project SARAI)

Project SARAI aims to provide science-based answers and solutions to some questions, such as “What and when to plant?” for its initial six priority crops: rice, corn, banana, coconut, coffee, and cacao. It is anchored on precision agriculture by optimizing the use of advances in technology such as crop and simulation modelling (CSM), remote sensing and geographic information systems (RS/GIS), and field sensors to develop decision support models for crop forecasting, crop advisories, and early warning systems.

The Project is divided into five different project components with different objectives and outputs:
